### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Developed using React, Axios, Material-UI (MUI), Ant Design.
- **Backend**: Powered by Node.js.
- **Mapping Integration**: Google Maps JavaScript API.

### Setup Guide
1. **Clone Repository**: Begin by cloning the Tea Leaf Management System repository from [GitHub URL].
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend.
3. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define environment variables such as database connection details, API keys, etc.
   - Example `.env`:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=username
     DB_PASSWORD=password
     ```
4. **Database Setup**: Set up your preferred database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) and configure the connection in the backend.
5. **Start Backend Server**: Run `npm start` in the backend directory to start the Node.js server.
6. **Start Frontend Development Server**: Run `npm start` in the frontend directory to start the React development server.
7. **Access Application**: Access the application through the provided URL (default: `http://localhost:3000`) in your web browser.
